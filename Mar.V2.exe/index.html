    <h1>- Mark's Virus 2 -</h1>
    
    <h2>- Lore -</h2>
      <p>
        Sam, a gamer, discovered Nintendo's Super Mario World but quickly grew bored of it. 
        He later found an application called Mar.V2.exe that claimed to expand the game to reality. 
        After running it multiple times with no success, he gave up. 
        Later, he found a new app called Yosh's-Reign.smc in place of Super Mario World. 
        Intrigued by the notification "Rewrite complete," he ran the app and saw a changed title screen with a Yoshi. 
        Upon starting the game, the screen flashed red, and he was forced to play as Mario with the name "Sam" displayed.<br><br>

        Shortly, he went missing with no explanation. 
        Later on, his cousins, Mark and Sarah, went to visit his parents since Sam and David were both missing, leaving only Nick left. 
        Nick said that Sam had played Mar.V2.exe before his sudden dissapearance. 
        Since Mark and Sarah loved playing games that are associated with mysterious events, they went to find as much as they could. 
        Mark found Sam's PC. 
        Unlike the expirence Sam had, 
        Mark actually saw something, something... different.<br><br>
