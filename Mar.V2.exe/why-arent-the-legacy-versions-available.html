We used to have a site called `mastercodebuild`, which was hosted on WIX.<br>
However, without explanation, they banned us. So we decided to re-read their (very long) terms to see if we did something wrong.<br><br>
We read it and found a link to "recently banned sites", so we clicked that and saw that basically every banned site involved gaming somewhat.<br>
So basically, WIX just doesn't like gamers.<br>
We tried emailing them several times, but they never responded to our emails.<br>
Because of this, every version ranging from 1.x.x to 6.x.x has been permanently deleted without restoration.<br><br>
We are sorry for any inconvience.
